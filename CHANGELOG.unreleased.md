  Description: optional if the `Title` is enough to explain everything.

Examples:

#### TypeScript: Correctly handle `//` in TSX ([#5728] by [@JamesHenry])

Previously, putting `//` as a child of a JSX element in TypeScript led to an error
because it was interpreted as a comment. Prettier master fixes this issue.

<!-- prettier-ignore --\>
```js
// Input
const link = <a href="example.com">http://example.com</a>

// Output (Prettier stable)
// Error: Comment location overlaps with node location

// Output (Prettier master)
const link = <a href="example.com">http://example.com</a>;
```
